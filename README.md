# 100DaysofCoding-Day3-Challenge

In this challenge it was a bit less straightforward as the previous ones but I am glad things are getting a bit more challenging. The biggest issue was actually loading the acsii image. 

This challenge entailed creating a treasure hunt game where you had choices to make and the choices would bring you closer to the gold. If you got the wring choices though, you would lose the game. It was a collection of multiple if statements and a few nested if statements as well. All in all, not too challenging but definetly taught me a thing or two that I had forgotten.
